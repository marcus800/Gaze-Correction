Gaze-Correction an Open Source Gaze Correction Software
===========================================================================


A project to correct the gaze of a live webcam or video to be looking at the camrea. This is perfomed by replacing
the eyes with saved images applying colour, shape and blending corrections to the live video.

The videostream can be displayed to an vitrual camera using pywebcam to be used with any exising software.

The project is written for windows and uses a pre-compiled dll of IntraFace for the FaceTracker.

This can be recompiled using the inclued cpp file to other OS's.

The lisance for IntraFace is lost.
